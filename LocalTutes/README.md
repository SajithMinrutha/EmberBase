# EmberStudy

A local, modern UI for organizing subject tutes by theory and revision.
Drop PDFs into the folders and the index updates automatically while the server runs.

## Folder structure

```
Tutes/
  Chemistry/
    Theory/
    Revision/
  Maths/
    Theory/
    Revision/
  Physics/
    Theory/
    Revision/
```

## Update tutes

```bash
node generate-tutes.js
```

### Auto-update (watch mode)

```bash
node generate-tutes.js --watch
```

## Run locally

```bash
node serve.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:5174`.

### Disable auto-watch

```bash
WATCH_TUTES=0 node serve.js
```

## Notes

- `tutes-data.js` is generated by `generate-tutes.js`.
- PDFs can be viewed or downloaded from the UI.
