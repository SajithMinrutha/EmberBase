# EmberVault

A local, modern UI for browsing AL past papers by subject. Drop PDFs into the
`PastPapers/` folders, and the index can be regenerated automatically while the
server runs.

## Folder structure

```
PastPapers/
  Chemistry/
  Maths/
  Physics/
```

## Update papers

```bash
node generate-papers.js
```

### Auto-update (watch mode)

```bash
node generate-papers.js --watch
```

## Run locally

```bash
node serve.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` (or `http://alpapers.local:5173` if you added a
hosts entry).

### Disable auto-watch

```bash
WATCH_PAPERS=0 node serve.js
```

## Add a local domain (optional)

Add to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 alpapers.local
```

## Notes

- `papers-data.js` is generated by `generate-papers.js`.
- PDFs can be viewed or downloaded from the UI.
